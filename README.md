# Multimodal Machine Learning Course Final Project (CIS4930)
Multimodal ML project on lie detection

*note - to run the audio modality code you must have a folder titled "video_clips", which then has a folder titled "lie" and another titled "truth", with respective video files in each one.

**note - above issue has now been patched!!!.
