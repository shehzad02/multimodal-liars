I don’t think too often, cause usually we just call each other. We would be texting. If we are both by a computer when you are on gmail, you can kind of see your contacts and who’s actually online. And I think at one point, she wrote ‘hi this is the text’, and I was online and I responded back to him that we started kind of just talking that way
