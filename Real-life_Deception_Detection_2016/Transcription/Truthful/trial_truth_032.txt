Um, cause she had mentioned that she'd been shot in the head and I could tell that her hair was soaked in blood. Um, at least one other officer, ah, arrived with me on Butterfly Creek. And then ah, once we figured out that the actual incident happened on Bernardino the rest of the officers, ah, went to that residence.
