Why didn't I understand my rights? Well, I'm not a coward. Do you get what I'm saying? All I know is this: My son is eight years old right now. He's going to forget a lot about me. Okay? When he'll look back at all this media cover from this bottle feeders I don't want him to see that I stood here like a coward. I did what I did, and I did what I did for my baby, period. He's going to see me standing up taking my responsability. I will happily do life in prison for my child, that's period. So, I don't understand what's... what, what other paper work is that to do...
