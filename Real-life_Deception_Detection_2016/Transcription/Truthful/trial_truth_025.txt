If this corrections aren't made in our system, its gonna happen to someone that you know. Trust me, its gonna happen, and I don't want ... I don't want anywhone to go through what I or my family have to go through. Because we went through the hell and back, and nobody in this country should have to suffer like that and I'll do my best to make sure this is not gonna happen to anyone else.
