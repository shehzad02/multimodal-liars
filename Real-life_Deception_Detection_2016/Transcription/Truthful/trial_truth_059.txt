We were married for two years, and um, we divorced when she was about 10 months old. And basically, we were just too young and didn't know what marriage was supposed to be about. And so, you know, just, I knew that I wanted to go to school. He was very jealous. Um, he really didn't want me to work or go to school, or even go to the grocery store.
