We proceeded to step back into the living room in front of the fireplace while William was sitting in the love seat. And he was still sitting there in shock and so they to repeatedly tell him to get down on the ground. And so now all three of us are face down on the wood floor and they just tell us “don’t look, don’t look” And then they started rummaging through the house to find stuff. They just asked- they asked who else was in the house and we didn’t say anything. We said “no one”
