I was born in Durango, Colorado. My mother was a single mother. I have two older sisters, Karen Berry and Dory Gardner. I have one older brother. I was um quite a bit younger than all of them so I primarily grew up by myself. Um I lived back and forth in Texas and New Mexico until I was about 6 years old. At that point my mother married my step father. Um I lived, we lived in New Mexico until I was approximately in fifth grade.
