I have no idea. A police officer I presume. You'd have to ask my mother or my brother. Nope. They said they didn't know where he was being taken. Yep. Went to the house, I was in a fairly catatonic state, my dad and my brother started making phone calls to all the local hospitals, and they eventually got a hold of... I don't know, whatever the hospital is, Atlanta Medical Center. And they wouldn't tell my dad anything but that he was being taken there. So we got in the car, and we left. That's correct. Yes, he was and I had, I -- that was instructed that that was the best idea was to keep him at the day care. The, uh ... Donna. The woman that runs the day care. Yep. That's the safest place ... uh for him to be.
