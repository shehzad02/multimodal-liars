Um, my daughter and ah, Nicole have been friends for a long time. Ah, pretty much cause they were both lifers for the class of 2005. And um, I had actually taught Nicole sophomore English. And Nicole and Megan had been in the band together for, I think, from like 7th to 10th grade. And um, no excuse me, basketball from 7th to 10th. And then in the band together from 4th through 12th.
