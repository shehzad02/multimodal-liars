I do. I was, uh... in the office, and I got a call ... uh, maybe ... close to nine o' clock, I don't remember, somewhere between eight and nine, from Rusty. He said, uh ... someone was just on the side of the house, and he was sort of not completely coherent, and said ... someone was, like, sleeping on the side of the house, and he called the police, and he was... oh and then he had to go really quickly to talk to the police, and then he ended up calling me back, and told me the whole story of what had happened, which was that, um... he had put Ian in the car as he does every day around that time, and Ian's car seat is on the right passenger side in the back, and as he walked around he smelled gas, um... as he walked -- 'cause he sort of exits the garage a little bit to get to his side of the car, he smelled gas, and, uh... our gas meter and pipe is on the side of the left side of the house if you're looking at the front. So he walked over to that spot, it's near our air conditioners,  and he said that there was a man lying face-down on the ground.
