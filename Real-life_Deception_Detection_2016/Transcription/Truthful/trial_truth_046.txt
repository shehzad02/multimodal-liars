They were...they were at the taller (?) table there,in the walk way. Um,we were staring all over the place,looking around,taking pictures. Inside,outside,capture as much as possible and they, uh, they kind of stopped me, uh, and started talking to me, and uh, um, the two girls and the two guys that had been drinking were trying to uh,to say something to me. None of it made sense, um they were telling me how they were amazed with how many pictures that were taken,and stuff but uh, most of what they said was not really understandable.
