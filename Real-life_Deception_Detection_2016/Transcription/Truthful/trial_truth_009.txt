I mean, it pops right upon the screen if you got you gmail open. and so somebody says, you know, hi, pops right up and, you can reply and you can also carry on the conversation while you are doing other things. But I mean it’s kind of like a text message back and forth that’s immediate you both responding right away. And sometimes you are even responding the things that 2 or 3 questions away, you know.
