I was sentenced to forty to sixty years in prision for this crime that I didn't commit. At the trial the judge had exceded the sentence guidelines because he said I failed to show remorse. And I told him, you know, I felt terrible for what happen to this woman, shoudn't happen to anyone, but I can't show remorse for somethig I didn't do.
