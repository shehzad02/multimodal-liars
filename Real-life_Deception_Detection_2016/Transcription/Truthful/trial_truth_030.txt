I started the investigation similarly to how I start all my, um, investigations as I, I have a, uh, what's called a primary briefing, where all of my assisting, uh, detectives and, uh, criminalistics detectives, the scientific portion of the investigation, as well as, um, members of the command staff once everyone's present and all the representatives there are from OMI, the district attorney's office. Uh, we get everybody together. Um, in this particular instance there was so many of us, uh, we did it inside the garage of, uh, Alexander Fixton's house. He was not present for any of the briefings but, he allowed us to use his, uh, garage. And uh, that's what started off the investigation, is I was, um, briefed up on some officers that were there on scene just so I could get a lay of the land, figure out kind of, uh, you know, a summary of what happened.
