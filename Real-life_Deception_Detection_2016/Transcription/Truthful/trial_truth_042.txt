As, from what my recollection, is I saw him pull out the two knives and then they go back. I'm, I'm going down. And all I can see is basically from my vantage point is his feet is just turning into what appears to be possibly to the to the east. I at that point I just looking at his feet so I'm assuming he was turning and went down to the ground.
