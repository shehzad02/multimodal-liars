yeah. I, maybe three months in the business, I was struggling, not doing so well. I was even thinking about quitting. And then at some point Alexander was flown into town as a guest speaker for solid city market. And I attended that training and I was inspired by him. It kind of changed my business around. And that was the only encounter with him personally. And so I just, I kept going and did much better after that.
