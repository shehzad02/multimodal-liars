No, when Rusty backed up out of the garage ... So Rusty had a communication with him, but -- now I know why -- but Hemy never responded, because if he had spoken, I'm sure Rusty would have recognized who he was. So he stayed silent the entire time. And Rusty panicked. He got into the car, backed out of the driveway, and once he was at the end of the driveway picking up the phone to dial 911, Hemy ran across the lawn, over to a place that only someone who had been stalking my house for months would have known existed.
