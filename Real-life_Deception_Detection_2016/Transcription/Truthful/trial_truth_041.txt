Um, I put on my soft body armor and put on, um, in the Repeat Offender Project we had hard body armor, uh, for, which was good for rifle rounds. So, it was augmented body armor. So I put that on. Um, I changed my glasses when I noticed the time of day. So, I changed the glasses from, um, my sunglasses to, uh, clear lenses, to have eye protection. Uh, got my department rifle, insured that I had my department rifle and my taser shotgun, and, um, made sure my body armor had the recording devices on it.
