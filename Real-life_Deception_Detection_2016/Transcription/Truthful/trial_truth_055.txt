Nothing that is what you typically see in a case like this, such as um a childhood where there was drugs, alcoholism, molestation, things like that. None of those things occurred in my family. Um, so, I don't know, I guess that we would sort of joke that my mom didn't beat me hard enough. So I don't really have a mitigation.
