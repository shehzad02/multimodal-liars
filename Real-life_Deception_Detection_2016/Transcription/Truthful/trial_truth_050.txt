At that time on December nineteenth we were also looking for some missing items. Uh, such as, uh, badge and a gun. And we, uh, we started driving up and down, you know, and through new castle. Um, we went on foot a couple times. Um, through New Castle Road and through Stadium Drive to look for, like, a badge or gun or any other evidence.
