The lunging and the gun going off were sort of contemporanios, I don’t remember how close they were or if it happened at exactly the same moment or one right after the other, it all happened very fast, and it all seemed to happen all at once, and I would say as far as distance, maybe as far as Mr. Babbikey (sp?) is, (court reporter?) but I couldn’t say for sure with absolute certainty.
