In a sense that is correct, I remember that. Dropping the knife, screaming and that  memory came much later,   Um, but it goes blank after that. I don't remember putting the gun in the car, I don't  remember putting the rope in the car, but I have, not crystal clear, but pretty, pretty solid  memories of disposing of those. So they did go in the car obviously, but I donâ€™t remember  placing them in the car.
