Lying is isn't something typically I just do. I'm not going to say I've never told a lie in my life before this ... incident, but, the lies I have told in this case are can be tied directly back to either protecting Travis' reputation or my involvement in his death, in any way. Because I was very ashamed of the death, and also I wanted to edify Travis in a good way, I didn't want to de- edify him or say hateful things about him, especially now that he had passed away and also I didn't want that to be construed as ... motive, for example if he was violent with me.
