as far as details, every detail, I just sometimes I have a general sense of what’s going on, and sometimes I don’t but as far as the fog goes, it’s more of again, words that are being spoken, or screamed or yelled, and that what processing that sort of thing, physical things I can remember because I feel them physically, I can remember what I feel internally and emotionally as well, but it’s more the words that are being spoken and their meanings, but I do remember how I feel, if that makes sense.
