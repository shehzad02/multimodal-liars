No, no. I did not and I had absolutely nothing to do with her disappearance. And I'm glad that she did. I did. I did. Um and then when Laci disappeared, um, I called her immediately. It wasn't immediately, it was a couple of days after Laci's disappearance that I telephoned her  and told her the truth. That I was married, that Laci's disappearance she didn't know about it at that point.
