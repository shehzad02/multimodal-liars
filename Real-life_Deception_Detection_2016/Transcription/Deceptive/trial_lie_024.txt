So I was experiencing disorientation, I wasn’t thinking gosh, Travis’ just choked me out, I was ...  actually a thought just sort of wandered through my mind  Wheres Nepolian, in my head  so that was my thought and it didn’t really have any relation to the event, that was just a thought. I was kinda getting my bearings, um, so there is, it’s not completely clear, I just remember he had his hands around my neck, and he was banging my head on the carpet. I tried to push him off, and then it was, and then I blacked out. Really shortly after that.
