I want to say, the prosecutor, I can't see her face but I wish I could. You disgust me. The Dorsey family disgusts me. Because how dare you say that happened to my son. You weren't there. Ya'll was never there. You were the absentee people ... always. So the Dorsey family, down to the mother, the father, to everybody- I hope ya'll live your lives well but Imma saying to my child, Gabrielle Blair, you lived well but Imma saying to 'em throughout their whole life. So live well now. You got not nothing else to say to me for I did for my child. Period.
