Well, what I do recall is when I filled the gas cans rather then have just a loose gas hose  somewhere I didn't have anywhere to put it, um so, I hung it up and when I  hung it up that ends the transaction, so that's probably why, I could have, you know mean, if I could of put them back in the trunk or whatever, then started the car or vise versa , um at one point, I didn't want to  ground, so I hung it up, and that ended the transaction, so thatâ€™s probably why there is more than one and maybe I was topping of the gas tank for another.
