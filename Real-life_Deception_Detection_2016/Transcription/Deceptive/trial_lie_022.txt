Well, I think that I have a good memory June 4th is an anomaly for me.  It's like I said yesterday, it's in a class of it's own. And I can't explain why, what kind of state of mind I was in, um it was, most of the day was an entire blank, and little pieces have come back, but not very many, So I can't explain that day alone but if you were, to put that day over here and over here all the other days of   memory issues that are any different from any average person.
