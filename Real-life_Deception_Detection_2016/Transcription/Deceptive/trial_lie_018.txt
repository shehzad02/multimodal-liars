My attempt to talk to them was to present a better image of our relationship, and to downplay the negative aspects of it, like \it's not really a big deal\" \"oh, it wasnâ€™t that bad\" that kinda thing, like \"oh, yeah, I knew that he did that, but that wasn't a big deal\" um, even our arguments, oh, sure it was rocky, there was turmoil, but we were friends, so my attempt was more to present a good image of Travis, and a good image of myself and that our relationship had it's ups and downs, but we were still um, on good terms."
