The first time I remember Mr. Miller he was...having kinda like an argument with the officers as we were moving the people out of the area toward the street, so that they could uh block the uh sidewalk. And uh, he was being very aggressive with the officers, we didn't understand why. We just needed everybody to follow orders, we just wanted everybody's safety. I mean we just have to give the orders to step down to the street.
