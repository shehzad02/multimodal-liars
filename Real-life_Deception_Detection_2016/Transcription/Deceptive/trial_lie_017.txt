Again, it took, it took a long time, it took a long time for me to get to this point, I never  wanted to admit to this and I'd written out all of my suicide letters, I sent my note, I sent them  all in an envelope to my grandmother, do not open until Nov 10th 2008, I was hoping to be  dead by then, giving myself a little time, to get my affairs in order, that date rolled by and then  more time rolled by and I was still here, so with the evolution of just time and the years that  went by, it was a gradual process, I began to feel not right about keeping it in instead.
